# PracticeBuddy

This is the source code for the app, but it is already deployed in Heroku, which can be accessed through this [Link](https://practicebuddy.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview

PracticeBuddy is a web application originated on the concept of practicing an instrument, where constant practice of different pieces and studies are needed simultaneously. For example, someone might want to practice certain scales, arpeggios, studies or concertos, and they are all needed to be practiced throughout the week. The objective is to have an overview of which pieces are practiced the most, and how they compare to the rest. 

The idea is to mark each day which pieces are practiced, so that the app recolects this data and makes stats for the user to see. This cannot be done with a mere to-do list, simply because practice is a never ending process. If you practice something today, you'll need to practice the same thing in the future. That is why the idea is to have the same list to check, which is reseted every day.

This is a PWA app, in order to be accesed quickly on any device when the instrument is practiced.

## About the creator and the origin of the app

Hey! I'm In√©s, a Software Engineer from Argentina. I made this app as a final project for a subject in University. I have played the violin for some years now, and understand the necessary practice process for any professional musician. On that note, I was facing a challenge to keep record and see the quality of my practice. Luckily, the requirements for my Uni project fit a solution for my problem, and I hope other people might also find some use for it.
